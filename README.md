# Quick Browser Notes

This is a very simple note-taking app that stores a note in your local storage. You can switch between edit and viewing (rendered Markdown) mode by pressing `CTRL+m`.

Please be aware that this is merely a tiny personal project that I came up with because I wanted to have a minimalistic and convenient way of quickly jotting down things in a browser tab.
